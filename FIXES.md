# Playwright Testing Setup

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Browser Installation Issues
- **Problem**: Playwright browser downloads were failing
- **Solution**: Modified `playwright.config.ts` to use system Chrome browser instead of downloading Playwright browsers
- **Configuration**: Set `channel: 'chrome'` to use system-installed Chrome

### 2. Code Syntax Errors
- **Fixed in `mysecondPlaywrightScript.spec.ts`**:
  - Line 13: Corrected error message from `#item-:` to `#item-0`
  - Line 14: Updated screenshot filename from `error-item-20.png` to `error-item-0.png`
  - Line 41: Fixed selector from `'id=item-1'` to `'#item-1'`

- **Fixed in `myFirstPlaywrightScripts.spec.ts`**:
  - Fixed dialog handling by moving event listener setup before button click
  - This prevents missing dialogs that appear immediately after clicking

### 3. Configuration Improvements
- Added timeout settings for better handling of slow networks
- Temporarily disabled Firefox and WebKit for faster testing
- Added actionTimeout and navigationTimeout settings

## Running Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Install system dependencies for Playwright
npx playwright install-deps

# Run tests in parallel
npm run test:parallel

# Run tests serially
npm run test:serial

# Run specific test file
npx playwright test tests/myscript/simpleTest.spec.ts
```

## Test Files
- `myFirstPlaywrightScripts.spec.ts` - Tests for the-internet.herokuapp.com
- `mysecondPlaywrightScript.spec.ts` - Tests for demoqa.com  
- `simpleTest.spec.ts` - Basic test to verify Playwright functionality

## Notes
- External website tests may fail in environments without internet access
